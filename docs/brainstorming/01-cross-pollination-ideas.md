62. **"Avoid Tolls" Mode** — Set avoidance criteria (vendor lock-in, monitoring burden, etc.)

## Key Design Decisions Made During Phase 1

1. Architecture stats are **static/objective** — player profile is a separate gap analysis layer
2. **Three-Tab Toolbox**: Components | Stacks | Blueprints (explicit, not fluid)
3. **AI advisors deferred** to later development — blueprints and community library are Day 1
4. Components need **quick explanation cards**, categories/tags, and **challenge-based browsing**
