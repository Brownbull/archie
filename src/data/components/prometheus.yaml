description: Open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit with time-series database
is: A pull-based monitoring system that collects metrics, stores them in a time-series database, and triggers alerts
gain:
  - Powerful PromQL query language for metric analysis
  - Pull-based model simplifies service discovery
  - Rich ecosystem (Grafana, Alertmanager, exporters)
cost:
  - Local storage not designed for long-term retention
  - Pull model less suited for short-lived/serverless workloads
  - Cardinality explosion with high-dimensional labels
tags:
  - monitoring
  - metrics
  - alerting
  - observability
